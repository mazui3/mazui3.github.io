<ol>
<li><p>Gather background information: this may include collecting background information about the project, analyzing any potential risk associated with the project. Techniques like PESTLE analysis, porter‚Äôs five forces framework could use used for this purpose.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Identify stakeholders: they are decision makers of a project and approver for requirements and priorities. Stakeholders may range from project owners to senior managers, end users, and even competitors.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Discover business objectives: this is to understand the business needs of the project before going deep into the project. SWOT analysis (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats), benchmarking, analyzing business objectives SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic, and Timely), and listing business objectives are some of the techniques used for this purpose.</p>
</li>
<li><p>evaluate options: this is to identify the options to achieve business objectives. Impact analysis, risk analysis, cost-benefit analysis are some of the methods which are used for this purpose.</p>

<li><p>Scope definition: a scope is a project development goal which is set based on the business objectives. A scope definition document is used to detail the goals for each phase of a project.</p>
</li>
<li><p> Business analyst delivery plan: based on the project scope, stakeholders availability and project methodology a document called business analyst is created at this step. The document provides information on deliverable with their timeline.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Define project requirements: in this step, two type of documents are used.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>functional requirement document and non-functional requirement document. Based on the development methodology to be used in the project, the business analyst needs to clarify the requirements with the stakeholders by interviewing them on the requirements and get the sign off on the same.</p>
<ol start="8">
<li><p>Support implementation through SDLC: this is the technical implementation step of the requirements where a business analyst gets involved with different teams. This includes coordinating with the development team and testing team to ensure requirements are implemented as expected and appropriately tested against all the possible business scenarios. They also need to handle the change request which may arise from the stakeholders at the later point of time.</p>

Here are the top 5 reasons:</p>
<p>During the project kick-off session, there are high possibilities that some technical queries come up from stakeholder and clients; as we don‚Äôt involves the technical project team during this phase and immediate answering is essential, a business analyst may play a pivotal role to answer those queries.</p>
<p>The next phase after the kick-off session essentially involves some gap analysis, business process analysis, documentation, SOW review, project scheduling and of course preparing requirement specification documents.</p>
<p>A statement of work (SOW) is a document that provides a description of a given project‚Äôs requirements.<br>It defines the scope of work being provided, project deliverables, timelines, work location, and payment terms and conditions.</p>
<p>During the development and testing phase, a business analyst can play a significant role to resolve any requirement related queries from the project teams.<br>Besides that, he can validate whether the requirements are correctly implemented and tested considering different functional and non-functional scenarios.</p>
<p>In the waterfall model, new requirement or modification of requirements can be asked from stakeholders considering changing business needs.<br>In this case business analyst is the person who handle this change request with proper validation and analysis.</p>

<p>Business analytics - handles data and analyze data to get insights into a business. Finally, it generates reports.<br>Mainly four types of business analytics are used - descriptive analytics, decisive analytics, prescriptive analytics, and predictive analytics tools and technologies like Big Data, BI is used for this purpose.</p>
<p>Descriptive Analytics tells you what happened in the past.<br>Diagnostic Analytics helps you understand why something happened in the past.<br>Predictive Analytics predicts what is most likely to happen in the future.<br>Prescriptive Analytics recommends actions you can take to affect those outcomes.</p>
