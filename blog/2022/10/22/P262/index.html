<h2 id="Mind-mapping"><a href="#Mind-mapping" class="headerlink" title="Mind mapping"></a>Mind mapping</h2><blockquote>
<p>Remember, 1) without verification, a fact is not a fact, 2) just because you see it in print doesn’t mean it’s true, and 3) things change.</p>
</blockquote>
<br>
<br>

<p>Mind mapping process:</p>
<div class="note ">
            <p>For every research project, you will need to create two separate mind maps: one for your writing topic, and the other for your research plan.</p><ol><li>Draw a circle in the middle of the paper.</li><li>In the middle of the circle, write the name of your main topic.</li><li>Draw 10 to 12 lines radiating out from the center circle, and at the end of each line, draw another circle.</li><li>Now let yourself go. Fill in the blank circles with subtopics and related ideas. The point is to do whatever you feel like doing to get the ideas flowing.</li></ol><p>The key is to work quickly. This is how you force your right and left brain to work together. If you try to do this in an orderly, logical manner, your right brain will be stifled. But if you open the mental floodgates, allowing yourself to write down whatever pops into your mind, your left brain will be so occupied with the task of writing that it will forget to squelch the right brain’s creativity.</p>

<h2 id="Sources"><a href="#Sources" class="headerlink" title="Sources"></a>Sources</h2><p>Three kinds of sources: primary, secondary, and tertiary.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Primary sources are original materials from the original time period. These sources have not been rewritten or reinterpreted by anyone else. They include original documents (such as birth certificates, marriage licenses, court transcripts), personal interviews (in person, by telephone, or e-mail), photographs, diaries and letters, surveys, questionnaires and polls, and minutes of meetings.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Secondary sources consist of material you gather from published sources written after the fact, and are considered to be interpretations and evaluations of primary sources. If you are gathering information from primary sources, what you write as a result of that research will be a secondary source. Secondary sources include online and print newspapers, magazines, journals, biographies, and dissertations.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Tertiary sources are a further distinction of what some researchers might still call secondary sources. These tertiary sources are a compilation of facts and figures from both primary and secondary sources, and they include encyclopedias, almanacs, fact books (including trivia books), and dictionaries.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Difference between academic and anecdotal sources:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Academic materials consist of books, peer-reviewed journals, scientific studies, and databases—anything that has a scientific basis to back it up. Anecdotal sources are reports or observations without a scientific basis; in other words, anecdotal sources can be skewed by perspective.</p>

<h2 id="Libraries"><a href="#Libraries" class="headerlink" title="Libraries"></a>Libraries</h2><p>How to use libraries:</p>
<h3 id="Public-Libraries"><a href="#Public-Libraries" class="headerlink" title="Public Libraries"></a>Public Libraries</h3><p>First step to the library is to stop at the front desk or the information desk. Ask for a map or a directory of the library to help you get your bearings. A general idea of where things live in the library, combined with a good idea of what you’re looking for, will ease your way into researching mode.<br>Remember the Dewey Decimal Classification (DDC) system? Here’s how the DDC system works:</p>
<img src="/blog/2022/10/22/P262/P262_1.png" class="">

<p>When you retrieve a computer record of a book in the library, it will contain a call number that corresponds with the appropriate category in the DDC.</p>
<p>Contains in the academic libraries:</p>
<ul>
<li>Periodicals</li>
<li>Reference Books</li>
<li>Government Reports</li>
<li>Databases (like the EBSCO database)</li>
</ul>
<br>

<h3 id="Academic-Libraries"><a href="#Academic-Libraries" class="headerlink" title="Academic Libraries"></a>Academic Libraries</h3><p>Academic libraries usually use the Library of Congress cataloging system rather than the Dewey Decimal Classification system. The LOC system is much more detailed than the DDC.</p>
<img src="/blog/2022/10/22/P262/P262_2.png" class="">


<p>Contains in the academic libraries:</p>
<ul>
<li>Databases<br>Many academic libraries make databases such as LexisNexis available to anyone, but some will limit their use to enrolled students only.<blockquote>
<p>这个我记得,我在毕业后才知道…但是稍微上过一次,学校的database很牛逼,公司的财政收入都能看到.<br>虽然想找的是其他!</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
<br>

<h3 id="Specialty-libraries"><a href="#Specialty-libraries" class="headerlink" title="Specialty libraries"></a>Specialty libraries</h3><p>Specialty libraries exist in special places. Think museums, businesses, hospitals, government agencies, churches, and private organizations. Often such specialized groups maintain libraries of resources relevant to their specialty.<br>Although such specialty libraries might not normally be open to the public, sometimes all you have to do is ask. Even if you aren’t a member of the group, if you explain why you would like access to their library, chances are good that you’ll be successful. And even if you aren’t successful, you’ll probably get some good leads and advice.</p>

<h2 id="Personal-interviews"><a href="#Personal-interviews" class="headerlink" title="Personal interviews"></a>Personal interviews</h2><h3 id="Questioning-Techniques"><a href="#Questioning-Techniques" class="headerlink" title="Questioning Techniques"></a>Questioning Techniques</h3><p>Skilled interviewers know that how they phrase their questions is almost as important as the content of the questions. There are two basic forms of questions: closed and open.</p>
<p>Closed questions often begin with who, when, what, and where, and can usually be answered with a single word or a short phrase. An even more refined form of a closed question is one that can be answered with yes or no. Closed questions give you facts, and they are easy for people to answer.</p>
<p>Open questions are designed to produce long answers. They require the subject to think and reflect, and they result in opinions and feelings. Open questions are the meat and potatoes of your interview. These are the questions you’ll labor over before the interview, and it’s important to put maximum effort into phrasing them to produce the desired results.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When I have a subject who starts to ramble, I tend to let it go for a while for two reasons.<br>First, it’s impolite to constantly interrupt, and second, you never know what you might learn.<br>If, however, after a few minutes, you realize that your subject’s ramblings about cleaning the birdcage are adding nothing to your interview, it’s time to redirect into something more substantive.<br>How do you do that? By employing a closed question. You’ll get a short answer, and you’re back in control of the interview and can change the subject.</p>
</blockquote>
<br>
<br>

<h3 id="Questioning-Pitfalls"><a href="#Questioning-Pitfalls" class="headerlink" title="Questioning Pitfalls"></a>Questioning Pitfalls</h3><p>When you conduct an interview, it’s important for you to keep any preconceived opinions to yourself. Your questions should be bias-free, and so should the tone of your voice.</p>
<p>Another pitfall to avoid is the stupid question.<br>Think about your questions. Don’t insult the intelligence of your subject.<br>Also, when you’re formulating your questions, try to avoid starting questions with the word why. The word has an accusatory ring to it, and you might put your subject on the defensive.</p>
<p>One last trap to avoid is being bamboozled by psychobabble. If your subject starts tossing around psychological terms, ask what they mean to him or her.</p>
<br>
<br>

<div class="note ">
            <p>Don’t be afraid of silence. You needn’t be concerned about filling every moment of the interview with talk. Sometimes a bit of engineered silence will give your subject the time needed to properly phrase an answer, to provide some additional information, or to even come up with that amazing quote interviewers crave.</p><p>Ask three times! If you’re asking a question that your subject doesn’t seem to want to answer or is trying to evade, ask it three times. Rephrase it if you have to, but when you ask the question the third time, your chances of getting an answer are excellent.</p><p>End-of-the-interview question. As your interview comes to a close, always, always ask this question: “Do you have anything to add, or is there anything I haven’t covered?” Nine times out of 10, you’ll get a piece of information that you never thought to ask about.</p><p>Thank your interviewee. I don’t mean just a polite thank you as you walk out the door—send a note, leave a voice mail message, or write an e-mail expressing your heartfelt thanks for the interviewee’s time and expertise. This has the added benefit of opening the door for follow-up questions in case you think of something you forgot to ask.</p>

<h3 id="Property-Records"><a href="#Property-Records" class="headerlink" title="Property Records"></a>Property Records</h3><p>Grant deeds, quitclaims deeds, easements, liens.</p>
<p>Most real estate records are maintained in a city or county recorder’s office, clerk’s office, or some similarly named agency.</p>
<!-- Transfers of real property—including grant deeds, quitclaim deeds, and easements—are all duly recorded and made available to the public, contain information such as names of sellers and buyers, description of the property (including the address), and the date the transaction was recorded. Construction liens, tax liens, and sometimes, even judgments from civil litigation can be filed against a piece of property. The lien information is added to the property record and remains there forever—even after the lien or judgment is settled and released.

There are two ways to access property records. The traditional way is cumbersome and time consuming, but in many areas this is still the only way to see these records. You have to visit the recorder's office in person. You then have to search an index—either on microfilm or computer—by name, address, or parcel number.

The second method, which is supremely preferable, is by computer. You still have to visit the recorder's office, but most are now computerizing their records. The most current records will be right there on the computer, linked to the index. This makes searching much easier and faster. In some cases, you can even locate property records on the Internet, and order copies to be sent to you by mail. You usually can't view the entire record, but often you can see enough of it to decide whether or not you would like a copy. -->

<!--
Another interesting record related to property is your area's collection of plot maps and lot books. When a neighborhood is subdivided, the subdivision map must be recorded and preserved for posterity.

Lot books keep a record of property values for tax assessment purposes. They contain the number of lot, the number of acres, the name of the property owner, a description of the property, the mortgage number, and the dollar value of the property and improvements.

Tip: If your city or county has a historical society, contact it to see if it maintains a collection of public records. Sometimes you'll get lucky, and the historical society will have everything you need, saving you lots of trips and lots of time.

There's one other record that's related to real estate: tax records. Your area undoubtedly has an assessor's office, one that values (assesses) property and collects the associated taxes. This sounds like fairly cut-and-dried stuff, but it can open a window to what's going on with property owners.

If property taxes are unpaid or even paid late, the information is noted on the property owner's record. When you're looking for signs of financial distress in a person you're researching, this is one of the first things to check out. It's amazing what stories real estate records can tell, and once you work with them for a while, you'll get a sense for what you can uncover. -->

<p>Very best source for interesting and relevant information on candidates, politicians, and other public servants comes from the forms they are required to file—forms that in turn become part of the public record.</p>
<!-- I've saved one of the most fascinating groups of public records for last: public office and election records. Many times during my career as a writer, I have been called upon to do some type of political writing. Over the years, I've found that the very best source for interesting and relevant information on candidates, politicians, and other public servants comes from the forms they are required to file—forms that in turn become part of the public record.

Filing requirements, naturally, vary from location to location. But if your area has an active political watchdog agency, you should be able to get your hands on some very interesting forms. California, for example, has an agency called the Fair Political Practices Commission that oversees every aspect of a person's public life, beginning with candidacy or appointment, all the way through his or her actions while in office. The forms required by the FPPC and other states' agencies can be revealing.-->

<ul>
<li>Campaign Contributions</li>
</ul>
 <!-- Candidates running for political office must file reports containing the names, amounts donated, addresses, and occupations of all those who contribute money or in-kind goods or services to the campaign. (An example of in-kind goods or services donations might be office supplies or free printing.)

 From these reports, researchers get an idea of the people and groups that support a particular candidate. For example, if a candidate's report contains two dozen contributions from individuals, and all those individuals work for XYZ Company, you might start to wonder about the connection between XYZ and the candidate. These little connections provide the critical openings for further research by political writers.

 If you've ever read stories or articles about political campaigns, they usually include mention of how much money has been raised by the candidates. Campaign contribution forms are the source of that information. The candidates themselves don't usually like to talk about how much money they've raised, but the forms tell the story. -->

<ul>
<li>Statement of Economic Interest</li>
</ul>
 <!-- In most areas, public figures are required to file a form that reveals their assets and sources of income. They usually have to reveal their spouse's assets and sources of income too. The reason for this is to prevent a public official from acting on an issue in which there might be a conflict of interest.

 For example, imagine that Mayor Jane Doe has a significant amount of money invested in the stock of ABC Company. When ABC Company comes before the city council asking for property or sales tax breaks, Mayor Doe would be wise to excuse herself from the vote. If she doesn't, her statement of economic interest will give interested parties (usually news writers) all the ammunition they need to reveal her conflict of interest.

 Researchers often will spend weeks poring over statements of economic interest and then reviewing a public official's votes on a variety of issues, all held up to the light of the economic interest report.

 Other required political reports can include campaign expenditures, campaign disclosure forms (which typically contain information on campaign officials), and reports to be filed by lobbyists. The Web site for California's Fair Political Practices Commission lists more than 40 different reports that must be filed by public officials, political candidates, and lobbyists. Lucky for us researchers, they all are part of the public record.

 Public officials' records can usually be obtained in the building where their offices are located. If you were seeking a statement of economic interest from a city council person, you would go to city hall. If you want a candidate's statement from a statewide campaign, you would have to contact an office at the state capitol building. There will assuredly be a fee involved in getting your copies.

 Before we leave the land of public records, I'd like to quickly review just a few more that might be of interest. -->

<ul>
<li>Probate</li>
</ul>
<!-- Probate records used to be such fun. When a person died, the will had to go through the court system and be publicly administered. In other words, a court-appointed official would oversee the divvying up of the estate. All the decedent's bequests then became part of the public record. The divvying up of the estate resulted in some great info, especially if the person was well known.

These days, most people with any significant assets transfer all of them into a private trust. Trusts don't have to go through probate, so the disposal of the estate remains private. Too bad. However, if someone dies without a trust in place or without a will, and the assets are more than a certain amount, the probate court takes over. So every once in a while a good probate case will still surface. Probate case files are maintained by your courthouse, usually in the same place that civil cases are kept. -->

<ul>
<li>Agendas and Minutes</li>
</ul>
<!-- Every meeting conducted by public officials must contain two things: an agenda and minutes. These too, are part of the public record and available to researchers. You can usually get agendas far enough in advance to determine if there's a meeting you'd like to attend. Minutes are great for finding out what happened after the fact. Oftentimes, agendas and minutes will have supporting documentation that elaborates on agenda items.

Many agendas are posted on public Web sites, and sometimes minutes are too. If not, you'll have to make a trip to the agency to request your copies.-->

<!-- Now let's switch gears and take a look at what could possibly be a valuable ally to a researcher trying to track down public records: professional search companies. -->

<ul>
<li>Professional Search Companies</li>
</ul>
<!-- Most researchers really do enjoy doing their own hunting, but sometimes it's just not possible to access public records in a distant city, or to find records that you're sure exist but have no idea where. Also, we writers seldom have the luxury of unlimited time, and deadlines often dictate how much time we can spend on research. There may come a time when you need to enlist the services of a professional search company.

There is no shortage of these companies. With the advent of the Internet, the ease of compiling and accessing public records databases worldwide has generated tons of companies that are more than willing to help you find what you need—for a fee, of course.

Researchers and writers are notoriously budget-conscious, and it rankles us to have to pay for anything but the occasional photocopy. Sometimes, however, we have to grit our teeth and dust off the old credit card.

These companies have access to public records databases around the world. They can find, in a matter of minutes, what you might spend months seeking. I really prefer to do my own research, but I have used search companies before when I've been racing to meet a deadline, and I'm very grateful they exist. I've also used them when I've been clueless about where to look. Again, I'm thankful to have this resource available when I need it.

Search companies have various ways of offering their services. Some will offer you the opportunity to access their databases for a limited time, say, one day, one week, or one month. The fee, naturally, increases as the amount of time you sign up for increases. If you know exactly what you're looking for and that your search can be completed within a definite period of time, this might be the way for you to go.

Then there are other companies that do the search for you and charge on a per-search basis. The fees vary greatly and are established according to what kind of a search you require. A simple birth, death, or marriage certificate search would be on the low end of the scale—as low as $10. More complicated searches, such as real estate records or criminal background checks will naturally be more expensive. If your research is going to be conducted sporadically over several months, the per-search approach might be more appropriate for you. -->

<!-- I've included a link in the Supplementary Material section of this lesson to a clearinghouse for professional search companies. Most of these companies are honorable, and most will give you exactly what you want. But for some reason, there is a good supply of disreputable search companies out there, so please check with the Better Business Bureau for complaints before you turn over your credit card number. I've also provided a link to the BBB site where it's easy to do a quick search for complaints. -->

Constituency polls are used to determine how voters would cast their ballots at a given point before the election.

Exit polls are used to measure how voters have voted immediately upon leaving the polling place. -->

<p>According to Priscilla Salant, author of How to Conduct Your Own Survey, an accurate sampling has four requirements:</p>
<ol>
<li>The sample is large enough to yield the desired level of precision.</li>
<li>Everyone in the population has an equal (or known) chance of being selected for the sample.</li>
<li>Questions are asked in ways that enable the people in the sample to respond willingly and accurately.</li>
<li>The characteristics of people selected in the sampling process, but who do not participate in the survey, are similar to the characteristics of those who do.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>You must determine three factors: how much error you can tolerate, the size of the population, and how varied the population is with respect to the characteristics of interest.</p>
</blockquote>
<br>
<br>

<h3 id="Writing-Questions"><a href="#Writing-Questions" class="headerlink" title="Writing Questions"></a>Writing Questions</h3><ol>
<li>Are your survey questions phrased so that they require an answer from each respondent?</li>
<li>Can respondents accurately and honestly recall the answers to your questions?</li>
<li>Will respondents be reluctant to answer your questions?</li>
<li>Are the questions easy enough so that respondents will answer all of them?</li>
</ol>
<!-- Now let's pick apart questions even more. One of the most important questions you can ask yourself is this: Is this question necessary? Think about some of the surveys you've filled out. They often will contain questions about your age, education, income level, and so on. Don't think that just because these are common survey questions that you have to include them in your own. Every question should be absolutely specific to the data you wish to gather.

Also, watch out for multiple elements within a question that might frustrate a respondent, as in this example: “Do you like doughnuts and bagels?” If you ask a question like this, you're almost guaranteed to have a number of respondents who like one but not the other, and, not knowing how to answer the question, they skip it. Or, even worse, they throw the survey away. If you really need data on both doughnuts and bagels, it's better to separate them into two questions.

Another pitfall to avoid is presuming your respondents have information that they actually don't. Consider this question: “Do you think the Marshall Plan was a model for future cooperation among nations?” This question assumes that respondents know about the Marshall Plan and can answer the question. It would be better to filter a question such as this by first asking a yes or no question, such as, “Are you familiar with the Marshall Plan?” Then give respondents a direction: “If yes, go on to the next question. If no, proceed to Question 10.”

Next, beware of making your questions too general. A question that is too general would be something like “How did you like the ballet?” Your responses are likely to be all over the board and not have much useful information. But if you rephrase it into a few specific questions, you'll get answers that might actually mean something. “Would you attend another performance by this troupe?” Or, “Would you recommend this ballet to others?”

Finally, and as always, take care to not inject bias into your questions. If you ask “What are the advantages of a shorter lunch hour?” you're asking about only one side of the issue. A better question would be “What are the advantages and disadvantages of a shorter lunch hour?” -->

<p>The TDM methodology basic elements:</p>
<ul>
<li>Minimize the burden on respondents by designing a survey or questionnaire that is attractive, has questions categorized in easily understood sections that flow vertically, and has personal questions at the end.</li>
<li>Personalize your communications. If you plan to do a mailing, make sure it is personally addressed; if your contact will be by e-mail, try to have a name that goes along with the e-mail address.</li>
<li>Engage your respondents in the process. Send out a letter or e-mail before the actual survey or questionnaire goes out, letting them know it’s coming and what it’s about. Also, build in some type of reward for respondents, even if the reward is limited to the expressed appreciation of the survey’s sponsor.</li>
<li>Be scrupulous in your follow-up. Reminder postcards, e-mail messages, and telephone calls will increase the rate of response significantly.</li>
</ul>
 <br>
 <br>

<p>The most successful surveys will consist of a series of four steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>A pre-notice letter or contact, letting people know the survey is coming and what it’s about.</li>
<li>The survey or poll itself.</li>
<li>A reminder notice sent approximately 10 days to two weeks after the survey is distributed.</li>
<li>A replacement survey or poll.</li>
</ol>

 <!-- In addition to fascinating information about a person's military career, military records contain valuable clues to a veteran's former and current whereabouts. Military records are obtainable, but you need some private information to get copies of them. At a minimum, you'll need the veteran's complete name and Social Security or service number. Even though people zealously guard their Social Security numbers these days, they aren't that hard to find. Try doing a quick search of public records. Sometimes you'll get lucky and find the Social Security number on one of the records. If you have no luck tracking down the Social Security number on your own, try using one of the private search companies that specialize in finding them. -->

<h3 id="The-High-Road-The-Freedom-of-Information-Act"><a href="#The-High-Road-The-Freedom-of-Information-Act" class="headerlink" title="The High Road: The Freedom of Information Act"></a>The High Road: The Freedom of Information Act</h3><p> FOIA document request.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, Ireland, and the United States have all passed FOIAs to allow public access to a wide array of government documents.</p>
</blockquote>
<!-- One shining example of information obtained through a successful FOIA case back in the 1970s revolved around the infamous Ford Pinto and its exploding gas tank. The U.S. Department of Transportation was sued for documents it possessed relating to deficiencies in the car's gas tank design. The suit was successful, and the resulting media attention got the car recalled.

There is no form to submit when you make an FOIA document request. All you need to do is write a letter to the government agency that has the documents you want, and provide as much information about them as you can. Mark both the envelope and the letter “Freedom of Information Request.”

When you are successful in getting documents released through an FOIA request or lawsuit, the information is almost guaranteed to be compelling, revealing, and eminently useful to your writing project.

Let's get back to our quest for documents related to Megabucks Company and its lucrative contract. Our first step is to make a formal request under the Freedom of Information Act for documents related to Megabucks' contract. In theory, the government should then produce the requested documents. In practice, government officials will usually kick and scream when their official view of reality is challenged and respond with a resounding “No.”

So our next step is to file suit under the FOIA. If we're lucky, the court will agree that the government should fess up about its dealings with Megabucks, we'll get our documents, and our writing project will be a huge success.

An FOIA lawsuit has some drawbacks. For one, lawsuits can take months—even years—to resolve. Most writers don't have months and years to wait. For another, FOIA lawsuits are becoming increasingly futile as governments fall back on two nearly failsafe arguments for maintaining secrecy: the right to privacy and national security.

More and more often, FOIA cases are being dismissed with the conclusion that access to data contained in government-held files would invade personal privacy. Furthermore, whenever the world has active pockets of instability, which it almost always does these days, national security is a frequent and effective argument for maintaining secrecy.

So much for the high road. It's worth a try, but your prospect for victory can sometimes be slim. Occasionally, though, especially if you're dealing with local government rather than state or national, the mere threat of an FOIA lawsuit is enough to produce the required information. Threats are good things when the law backs you up in making them.

When the high road does not lead us where we want to go, we have to let our standards slip a little and head down the middle road. -->

<h3 id="The-Middle-Road-Personal-Contacts"><a href="#The-Middle-Road-Personal-Contacts" class="headerlink" title="The Middle Road: Personal Contacts"></a>The Middle Road: Personal Contacts</h3><p>Follow the trail, for example LinkedIn or Facebook.</p>
<!-- When you're dealing with large companies like Megabucks, or even smaller local ones, it's not hard to find a current or former employee who is willing to talk. Former employees are good because once they have severed ties with the company, they usually have no reluctance to talk. Current employees are good because they often have the inside track on what's happening right now.

To find employees, current or former, try LinkedIn or even Facebook. You can search on a company's name and get lots of good results.

Once you've made contact with an employee, you can usually start up a conversation that will lead you to the next piece of the story. (Details on how to successfully initiate such a conversation are in the next chapter.)

Yes, you are, in effect, asking someone to tell tales out of school. If this starts to become distasteful to you, remind yourself of the greater good. If you're working on a project that could be a major exposé that would serve the public good, your tactics are absolutely justified.

Sometimes, however, even these middle-road tactics fail. If that's the case, it's time to abandon all civility and head down the low road. -->

<p><strong>Finding Contacts:</strong></p>
<!-- Patience is often required when you're finding and cultivating contacts. You have to think creatively. While LinkedIn is my favorite method for finding employees, you should have some back-up plans in case no one from the company you're investigating has registered on that helpful website. -->

<p>Is there a gym near the building where the company is located? If so, watch to see if employees go there before or after work, or during lunch.</p>
<!-- Once you've identified a few faces as being company employees, join the gym on a trial basis. Strike up a conversation with a likely subject, and you will be on the road to cultivating your contact. -->

<p>Ask for a tour of the company’s facility.</p>
<!-- Make up some excuse about writing an article or doing research in your capacity as an assistant to a professor at a nearby university. Take advantage of every opportunity to ask questions—be alert for any clues you might pick up. -->

<p>Many high schools have shadow programs that pair high school students with employees for a day to get an idea of what their job entails.</p>
<!-- If you're young enough to pass for a student, request a shadow day. Otherwise, say you're putting together a shadow program proposal for area high schools, but you need to test it with a few companies first. Ask for a day with an employee. By the time the day is through, you will have cultivated your contact. -->

<p>Pretend you’re someone you aren’t.</p>
<!-- For example, let's say you've obtained the name and contact information of an employee, either through LinkedIn or from a friend of a friend. If you were to approach this person by saying you're collecting information to write an exposé on the company, your contact would probably refuse to speak to you. Say you're thinking about applying for a job at the company, and you want to get a sense of what it's like to work there before you apply. -->

<!-- If you decide to be deceptive, such as pretending to be a job applicant seeking perspective from an employee, make sure you do your homework. Investigate first to make sure the job you say you're applying for actually exists. Also, if you can, find out the name of the human resources director. If you say you're a professor's assistant, make sure you have the name of an actual professor at an actual university. Cover your bases in case your contact asks questions. You don't want your deception to be exposed. -->

<h3 id="The-Low-Road-Dumpster-Diving"><a href="#The-Low-Road-Dumpster-Diving" class="headerlink" title="The Low Road: Dumpster Diving"></a>The Low Road: Dumpster Diving</h3><p>Notice: If you’re considering sifting through someone’s trash, please check with your local police department to be absolutely certain you won’t be violating any laws.</p>
<!-- Laws vary in different locations, but when the act of pilfering someone's trash has been tested in court, it usually is found to be legal. The litmus test is that once a person places trash in a container that is outside the confines of their private property, the trash is fair game. For us diehard guerrilla researchers, this means we're going to get our hands dirty. -->

<!-- Let's say Megabucks has a cleaning crew that disposes its trash in a Dumpster every evening. How convenient for us. Now we can do some Dumpster diving and see what's there. Many a secret has been exposed by the careless disposal of a memo or a file that should have been shredded.

There was a case in the late 1990s in which a woman was suing her former church for sexual exploitation. The church leaders, in an effort to defend themselves, hired a private investigator to raid the trash bin of the woman's lawyers, and the investigator came away with a mountain of confidential documents related to the case.

Employees are usually fairly protective of official documents, but you'd be amazed at how cavalier their attitude is about draft documents, printed-out e-mails, memos, and other informal documents. They frequently throw them away unshredded because they aren't formal or finalized, and thus they don't seem to have any importance. Not to them, maybe, but to Dumpster divers they are as precious as diamonds. We'd love to find a few draft documents in Megabucks' Dumpster, wouldn't we?-->

<br>
<br>

<h3 id="Getting-People-to-Talk"><a href="#Getting-People-to-Talk" class="headerlink" title="Getting People to Talk"></a>Getting People to Talk</h3><p>You could tentatively test the waters with some innocent-sounding questions.</p>
<!-- “I hear Megabucks got a great contract with the government. How did they get so lucky?” Or, “Megabucks must have a good reputation to get such a good deal. Do they have contacts with the government?” -->
<p>Chances are, even if your contact has no direct information, he or she will probably know someone who does.</p>
<h3 id="Blowing-Your-Cover"><a href="#Blowing-Your-Cover" class="headerlink" title="Blowing Your Cover"></a>Blowing Your Cover</h3><p>Sometimes it’s more productive to lay your cards on the table and hope for the best.</p>
<!-- Caught red-handed, all he could do was confess. He identified himself as a reporter, and said he was at a loss to understand why Carol had killed herself and was hoping to find some clue in the trash. The conversation went like this:

Reporter: I'm so sorry to intrude. But I'm a reporter, and I'm just trying to understand why Carol committed suicide. Everyone is baffled. Do you have any idea why?
Roommate: I can't help you, and get off my property.

Reporter: I'm really sorry; I know this is a tough time for you. But we're all so shocked. I guess I'm just looking for some answers.

Roommate: I don't know. You really need to leave.

Reporter: Can you even speculate? Even if I can't report the story, I'd personally like to know why she did it.

Roommate: I wish I had all the answers. . . .

And with that, she started talking and gave my friend more information than he ever hoped to get. Do you remember the “ask three times” technique from our lesson on personal interviews? This is the method my friend used. He asked the roommate—gently and respectfully—three times why she thought Carol had committed suicide. Keep in mind that this was a very angry woman when she saw my friend digging through the trash. But by the third question, she defused and deflated, and started talking.

Sometimes the direct approach works wonders. -->

<h3 id="Whistleblowers"><a href="#Whistleblowers" class="headerlink" title="Whistleblowers"></a>Whistleblowers</h3><p>If you can make contact with a whistleblower, all your prayers will be answered. Every researcher craves a willing witness, a cooperative tell-all.</p>
<!-- Whistleblowers frequently feel let down by official channels after having pursued internal grievance procedures, professional associations, and the courts, with no luck. They typically are conscientious employees who believe in the system, which is why they speak out in the first place. They expect the problem to be dealt with and are shocked when they are ignored or, worse, attacked. If something unseemly is going on within a company or a government agency, it's very likely that a whistleblower is waiting in the wings to corroborate a researcher's suspicions. -->

<p>You can find a whistleblower in one of two ways.</p>
<ol>
<li>Hope that your contact will give you some clues to help you identify a potential whistleblower.</li>
<li>Abandon all pretenses and let it be known that you are investigating the company. Let your name become familiar, and wait for the whistleblower to contact you.</li>
</ol>
<!-- Clearly, these two methods oppose one another. If you employ one, you can't use the other. So you have to make a choice. Follow your instincts. If you think a whistleblower is lurking about, he or she could be your ticket to all the answers you're seeking.

The final nugget of wisdom I'm going to share with you is this: Think like the people who want to protect the information you're seeking. Put yourself in their shoes. If you can adopt their mindset, you'll have the inside track to exploiting their weaknesses. -->

<!-- How to Seek Permissions

Let's say you've decided to include in your own work some quotations, a paragraph or two, a photograph, or a chart from someone else's work, and you determine that you really need to get permission to reprint. How do you do it?

Your first step is to contact the publisher. If quoting from a book, open the book to the copyright page—the page in the front of the book that has publishing information. The name and address of the publisher should be listed there, and that will be your first contact.

If you're using a magazine or a journal, look through the front part until you find the publishing information. The name and address of the publisher will be included.

Before you start composing a permissions letter, check to see if the publisher has a Web site. If so, search the site to see if there's a permissions page. If you find one, the process is much simpler. There will be a fill-in form that you can complete and submit through the Web site.

Sometimes, though, you'll have to resort to tradition and write a letter to the publisher to secure permission. Your letter should contain the following components:

The title of the material you wish to reprint, and what portion of it you intend to use. Include page numbers, a chapter number or title, or something that identifies the section in question.
A description of the work into which you will be incorporating the copyright holder's work.
How many copies of your work will be printed and how it will be distributed.
A description of the reprint rights you are seeking. -->

<p>Attribution is guided by three principles: ethics, copyright law, and courtesy to readers who wish to identify and further study your sources.</p>

<!-- Even the best writers can get off track when it comes to incorporating research into their writing. It's not always easy to decide how to integrate source material into your text, but there are some basic guidelines to follow.

Your research should support your writing but not be the backbone of it. If all you're doing is collecting a bunch of other people's research and opinions, you aren't producing anything original. Make your work your own.
Direct quotes are good. Better is a summary or a paraphrase in your own words. The more of yourself you can put into your writing, the more impressive it will be.
Use direct quotes when the author says something so perfectly that it would lose its impact if you were to rephrase it.
When you use a direct quote, it rarely can stand alone. It needs your explanation of how the quote is germane to your topic. -->

<p>Title.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Does the title of your work give readers an idea of what’s to come? Does it adequately describe the contents of your work? Snappy titles aren’t always easy to come up with, but they are critical for motivating your readers to actually pick up your work.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Research question or thesis statement.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Make sure your purpose for writing is clear. If readers don’t get a good, upfront idea of what your problem or question is, they might not be able to sustain the motivation to continue.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Introduction.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Have you written a clear introduction that conveys the importance of your work and puts the thesis in context? And is it clear where your introduction ends and the body of the work begins?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Transitions.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Scrutinize transitions from paragraph to paragraph and from section to section. Make sure they flow smoothly and that the reader is carried along in a logical progression.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Order of material.</p>
<p>Research sources.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Does the research you’ve included truly support your thesis? Are your sources convincing or have you included some not-so-great sources just as filler? In fiction, the purpose is to advance the plot. In nonfiction and academic writing, the purpose is to make your point or prove your thesis.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Citations.</p>
<p>Balance.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Have you achieved a good balance between referenced sources and your own thoughts and insights?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Relevance.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Do you stay on topic throughout your work, or do you wander off into irrelevant material?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Conclusion.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Does your conclusion support your thesis? Think of writing as going from point A to B to C until you reach the desired conclusion. Readers should be able to easily follow your progression, and the conclusion is the payoff.</p>

<h3 id="Frequent-mistake-list"><a href="#Frequent-mistake-list" class="headerlink" title="Frequent mistake list"></a>Frequent mistake list</h3><ol>
<li><p>Between versus among.<br>As a general rule, between implies two persons or things, and among implies more than two.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Who versus whom.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Lay versus lie.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Hopefully.<br>Look at this sentence: “Hopefully we’ll catch the train on time.” What is meant by this sentence is “I hope (or ‘it is hoped’) we’ll catch the train on time.” Remember this: Hopefully is an adverb meaning in a hopeful manner that needs to describe a verb, such as “She waited hopefully for a good grade.” Hopefully is describing the verb waited.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Different from versus different than.<br><em>Different from</em> is most often the correct construct, even though you will see <em>different than</em> frequently. Always use <em>different from</em> for simple comparisons, and save <em>different than</em> for when your ear tells you it’s better or it would simply be too cumbersome to do otherwise.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Datum and data.<br>Although datum is technically the singular of the plural data, it is rarely used anymore. The plural data has evolved into a synonym for information, and thus is used as both a singular and a plural.<br>A word of caution, though: There still remains a clear distinction between the singular and plural versions of phenomenon (singular) and phenomena (plural), criterion (singular) and criteria (plural), and medium (singular) and media (plural).</p>
</li>
<li><p>Affect versus effect.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Disinterested versus uninterested.<br>Disinterested means impartial, and uninterested means lacking interest. An easy way to remember the difference between the two is this: Judges are disinterested (impartial) but not uninterested (lacking interest) in the cases before them.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Close proximity.<br>This is a phrase that writers love to use, but it’s redundant. Proximity means closeness, so the phrase close proximity actually means close closeness.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Imply versus infer.<br>Imply means to suggest or express indirectly. Infer means to draw a conclusion. Only the speaker can imply, and only the listener can infer.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Insure versus ensure.<br>Insure has the added meaning of protecting from financial loss. So if you’re writing about premiums and policies, be sure to use insure.</p>
</li>
<li><p>More importantly.<br>Technically, this phrase is grammatically incorrect. More important is the proper form.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Persuade versus convince.<br>Knowledgeable writers will convince (or create belief in) their readers of a fact, but persuade (or induce) them to do something.</p>
</li>
