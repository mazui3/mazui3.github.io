<p>The work of architect Josef Hoffmann and the Wiener Werstätte, or Vienna Workshops formed in Austria in 1903.<br>This co-operative of artisans and artists united with the goal of making products that merged pure and applied arts.</p>
<p>Designer Joseph Hoffmann used a geometric shape, the square, as the foundation for a set of marks to identify the organization.<br>A monogram of the letters WW was used on printed matter.<br>A stylized rose was used to identify products from the workshops.</p>
<p>By 1913 the Wiener Werstätte symbol was officially registered as a Trademark.</p>
<p>Despite the communal spirit of the Wiener Werkstätte there were accommodations for individual recognition.<br>Products were imprinted with both the workshop symbol and marks identifying each designer and craftsman involved in the production.</p>

<li><p>Olivetti was famous for the attention it gave to design:<br>Preoccupation with design developed into a comprehensive corporate philosophy, which embraced everything from the shape of a space bar to the colour scheme for an advertising poster.</p>

<ul>
<li>For Olivetti, the designer is not simply a “stylist” responsible for the aesthetics of the object, but a specialist who works side by side with the developer to make sure that the object’s characteristics and functional attributes are conveyed in as direct and genuine a manner as possible.</li>
</ul>
<p>In short, design is a question of substance, not just of form; it is the tool the company uses, through its products, graphics and architecture, to convey an image that is not simply appearance, but a tangible reflection of a way of being and operating.</p>

<p>In 1952, the Museum of Modern Art held an exhibit titled “Olivetti: Design in Industry”。<br>Logo design is another area to which Olivetti has always paid close attention, from the early versions designed by founder Camillo Olivetti, through the re-workings of Giovanni Pintori to the current trademark, designed in 1970 by Walter Ballmer.</p>

<p>As early as the 1930s, the Development &amp; Advertising Office, over the years, a number of painters, graphics artists, scholars and architects have been involved in the development of graphics art and advertising communication to match the Olivetti style and the characteristics of its products.</p>

<p>Paul Rand (1914-1996) remains one of the most famous graphic designers in the world.<br>An American graphic designer, best known for his corporate logo designs, including the logos for IBM, UPS, Enron, Westinghouse, ABC, and Steve Jobs’ NeXT.</p>
<p>Rand was educated at the Pratt Institute (1929–1932), Parsons The New School for Design (1932–33), and the Art Students League (1933–1934).<br>He worked in all aspects of graphic design and advertising agencies and started to gain national acclaim by his late 20s.<br>One of his early instructors, Laszlo Moholy-Nagy noted:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Among these young Americans it seems to be that Paul Rand is one of the best and most capable [. . .] He is a painter, lecturer, industrial designer, [and] advertising artist who draws his knowledge and creativeness from the resources of this country.<br>He is an idealist and a realist, using the language of the poet and<br>business man.<br>He thinks in terms of need and function. He is able to analyze his problems but his fantasy is boundless.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He played a pivotal role in the evolution of graphic design and advertising during the 1940s and 50s and he is renowned for his corporate logo designs.</p>
<p>In 1954, Rand became the design consultant to numerous large and influential companies—IBM, Westinghouse, and UPS.</p>

<p>Rand wrote: “A trademark is not merely a device to adorn a letterhead, to stamp on a product, or to insert at the base of an advertisement; nor one whose sole prerogative is to imprint itself by dint of constant repetition on the mind of the consumer public.<br>The trademark is a potential illustrative feature of unappreciated vigor and efficacy; and when used as such escapes its customary fate of being a boring restatement of the identity of the product’s maker.”</p>
<p>The role of the logo is to point, to designate—in as simple a manner as possible.<br>A design that is complex, like a fussy illustration or an arcane abstraction, harbors a self-destruct mechanism. Simple ideas, as well as simple designs are, ironically, the products of circuitous mental purposes.<br>Simplicity is difficult to achieve, yet worth the effort.</p>
<p>The effectiveness of a good logo depends on:</p>

<li>usability</li>

<p>The resulting design program, a multidimensional integration of logos, typography and color, developed to communicate to a multilingual audience.</p>

<p>Reflecting Mexician arts and crafts, adobe homes, paper flowers, marketplaces and clothing sang with pure colour.</p>
<p>The system encompassed pictographic symbols for athletic and cultural events, site identification, directional signs, information posters, maps, postage stamps, film titles, and TV spots.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“In theory, a corporate trademark represents the key visual phrase that conveys the essence of what is useful for a corporation to communicate about itself.<br>I find corporations almost as fascinating as people. Every company I have ever worked for has a unique aura.<br>The secret and the challenge are learning how to express and make comprehensible the subtext.”</p>

<p>The power of the hidden arrow is simply that it is a ‘hidden bonus.’ It is a positive-reverse optical kind of thing: either you see it or you don’t.

The power of the logo and the FedEx marketing supporting the logo is strong enough to convey clearly FedEx brand positioning.

<p>Johnson references (architecturally) historic elements. However, he does so with a twist. The irony comes when it is noted that the building is clad in a warm coloured stone contemporary materials, oversized historic elements with contemporary materials.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The irony comes to: here is no real purpose of that shape other than to reference.</p>

<p>International Typographic Style:</p>
<ul>
<li>use of sans serif typeface</li>
<li>use of just one font</li>
<li>use of hierarchy through size and weight</li>
<li>use of grids on single page items and multiple page documents</li>
<li>use of photography</li>
<li>creative use of placement of items to create negative space</li>
<li>anyone from any country could design and understand, it was neutral and universally</li>
</ul>
<p>The stylistic influences of European Modernism and The International Style on North American graphic design was immense.<br>But the social utopianism that was associated with it never reached NA.</p>
<p>Ironically this style was used by postwar global capitalists to promote their large multi-national corporations.<br>The simplicity of this style worked well as a unifying language of corporate identification across continents.</p>

<h3 id="Punk"><a href="#Punk" class="headerlink" title="Punk"></a>Punk</h3><img src="/blog/2022/12/06/P270/P270_70.png" class="">

<p>Music played a major role in defining the culture of the 1960s along with album covers and magazines such as Rolling Stone.</p>
<p>Punk bands created fast, hard-edged music, typically with short songs, stripped-down instrumentation, and often political, anti-establishment lyrics.<br>Punk design graphics was dominated by D.I.Y. (do it yourself) techniques, outrageous subject matter, collage, photocopied imagery, defaced images, and basically any technique that broke the rules or seized the viewer’s attention.</p>
<p>Punk was developed and worked outside the graphic design industry and system.</p>

<h3 id="New-Wave"><a href="#New-Wave" class="headerlink" title="New Wave"></a>New Wave</h3><img src="/blog/2022/12/06/P270/P270_71.png" class="">

<p>在Punk同一时期,算system里的流行是New wave.</p>
<p>In design, New Wave refers to an approach to typography that actively defies strict grid-based arrangement conventions.<br>Characteristics include inconsistent letter spacing, varying type weights within single words and type set at unusual angles.</p>
<p>Weingart is a Swiss graphic designer and typographer, who studied at the Basel School of Design with Emil Ruder and Armin Hofmann (leaders of the International Typography Style).<br>When he began designing, the classical ‘Swiss typography’ was the dominate style for designers.</p>
<p>Weingart started to repel against the conservative design dogma and strict limitations that stifled his playful, inquisitive, experimental temperament and he reacted strongly against it.</p>
<p>He recognized too many good qualities in Swiss typography to renounce it altogether,so he used the positive qualities of Swiss typography as a base from which to pursue new typographic frontiers.</p>
<img src="/blog/2022/12/06/P270/P270_72.png" class="">

<blockquote>
<p>“type must not always be set flush left/ragged right, nor in only two type sizes, nor in necessarily right-angle arrangements, nor printed in either black or red. Typography must not be dry, tightly ordered or rigid. Type may be set center axis, ragged left/ragged right, perhaps sometimes in chaos. But even then, typography should have a hidden structure and visual order.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Typographic innovations include:</p>
<ul>
<li>letterspaced sans serif type</li>
<li>bold-stair stepped rules</li>
<li>ruled lines punctuating and energizing space</li>
<li>diagonal type</li>
<li>the use italic type and/or weight changes within words and type reversed from a set of bars</li>
</ul>
<img src="/blog/2022/12/06/P270/P270_73.jpeg" class="">

<p> Weingart found that the more complex the media (regarding visual treatment and technical production), the greater is our need for the mastery of basic formal design principles and production techniques, before we can responsibly and effectively handle the media.</p>
<p> Working with traditional and new media which included:</p>
<ul>
<li>hand-composed lead type and the letterpress;</li>
<li>transparent film collages made with a repro-camera;</li>
<li>graphic images made on the computer;</li>
</ul>
<p>and lastly, new creations made possible by combinations of all of the above.</p>
<p>The sluggishness of lead type combined with the magic of film craziness and the infinite graphic possibilities of computers are perhaps the language of a new world of typography.</p>
<br>

<p>According to Friedman, ‘New Wave” had to do with being reductive – reducing messages in their essentials, relieving the typographic composition of extraneous information, producing a communication which purports to be universal.<br>Simplicity, precision and purity of form were the goals, and while I found that agenda important, it was also limiting.<br>So we experimented with ways of working against those limitations by including more information, different levels of information.</p>
<p>Legibility is based on order, convention, simplicity and on the reader as a passive recipient.<br>Readability/Unpredictability is the ability of a design to attract or seduce you, in an intense, virtually cluttered world, into reading it in the first place.<br>It is usually based on disorder, originality and complexity.</p>

<p>Greiman is recognized as one of the first designers to embrace computer technology as a design tool, and she is also credited with establishing the ‘New Wave’ design style in the US during the late 70s and early 80s.</p>
<p>Not only influenced by the International Style, but also by Weingart’s use of the New Wave style.</p>
<img src="/blog/2022/12/06/P270/P270_77.jpeg" class="">

<p>By the mid 1970s some of this complexity began to embellish basic American “Swiss” graphic design in the form of bars and rules and playful mixing of type sizes, weights and faces in an essentially formalist agenda.</p>
<img src="/blog/2022/12/06/P270/P270_76.png" class="">

<p>She began to experiment with ‘hybrid imagery’ a term referred to the synthesis of digital technology with traditional hand-drawn practices it was work that advertised it technology</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“I love this notion which exists in physics as well—that the observer is the observed, and the observed is the observer. The tools and technologies begin to dictate what and how you see something, or how the outcome is predictable.”</p>
</blockquote>
<img src="/blog/2022/12/06/P270/P270_78.png" class="">

<p>Before the appearance of “Design Quarterly” designers widely considered bit-mapped type and imagery not only unorthodox but unacceptable, straying too far from the clean, crisp precision of the International Style.<br>The computer itself was viewed as cold and unfriendly, wildly expensive, and a harbinger of the demise of fine design.<br>After the publication many designers felt compelled to reconsider the role of the computer in design practice and it triggered countless debates about computers, context, and creativity.</p>

<p>Other pioneers of the computer and digital font creation were Rudy VanderLans and Zuzana Licko.</p>
<p>Emigre was one of the first publications to use Macintosh computers and had a large influence on graphic designers. Its variety of layouts, use of guest designers, and opinionated articles also had an effect on other design publications.</p>
<p>Licko contsructed more fonts with bold, simple geometry, such as Matrix and Modula. Their cold, rational appearance served to anchor VanderLans’s free-spirited layouts.<br>Licko believed that the new technology could be the basis of a new aesthetic, she did not want to use the technology to continue to create in the old style, but that the compute and its limitations be the inventor of new forms.</p>
<img src="/blog/2022/12/06/P270/P270_80.png" class="">

<p>Every issue was different. Sometimes several articles would run through the pages concurrently, each text differentiated by font, size, leading, and column width.</p>
<p>Their work was viewed as a threat to Modernist ideals and an affront to universal notions of beauty.<br>Emigre played with preconceived notions and industry standards of how type and magazine layouts are meant to be viewed, experienced and read.</p>

<p>Tibor Kalman was the self-styled bad boy of the graphic design profession and a harsh critic of formulaic design.<br>He wanted designers to take greater responsibility for how their work influenced the surrounding culture.</p>
<p>Mr. Kalman described himself as more a social activist than a designer and constantly sought to use his work to promote causes like environmentalism and economic equality.<br>He opposed products that he considered harmful to the workers who made them, the environment or the consumer and never hesitated to tell his clients what he thought.</p>

<h2 id="Deconstruction"><a href="#Deconstruction" class="headerlink" title="Deconstruction"></a>Deconstruction</h2><p>Deconstruction is a style featuring fragmented shapes, extreme angles, and aggressively asymmetrical arrangements.<br>These formal devices are easily transferred from architecture to graphic design.</p>
<p>Deconstruction in architecture started in the 1980s in the work of Frank Gehry, Daniel Libeskind, Rem Koolhaas and others.</p>
<img src="/blog/2022/12/06/P270/P270_87.png" class="">

<p>Deconstruction rejected the project of modern criticism: to uncover the meaning of a literary work by studying the way its form and content communicate essential humanistic messages.</p>
<p>Deconstruction, like critical strategies based on Marxism, feminism, semiotics, and anthropology, focuses not on the themes and imagery of its objects but rather on the linguistic and institutional systems that frame the production of texts.</p>

<p>In graphic design deconstructivism started in the mid-late 1980’s and continuing into the late 1990’s and is strongly typographically driven.</p>
<p>Further developments of the deconstructivist typography in the 1990’s shifted the typographic practice towards a spatial, non-linear process:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>‘Communication is no longer linear, but involves instead the provision of many entry and exit points.’</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The page is no longer to be just “read” but also “perceived”, beyond the pure textual content, into all of its associative conjunctions: We are meant to “feel” rather than “read” a page.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Reading of text and the viewing of image should not be conceived of as discrete practices. Rather, reading and viewing overlap and interact syngergistically in order to create a holistic effect that features both modes of interpretation.”</p>
</blockquote>
<img src="/blog/2022/12/06/P270/P270_89.png" class="">

<p>The whole atmosphere of a particular page decided by its subject, and the type functions as a method of illustration as well as delivers a mood. It also emphasizes the interrelationship between the text and the pictures by overlapping them.</p>

<p>Brody’s initial aim was to search for new typographical expressions for the age of electronic media, and evolved into a format for designers to become publishers and by assuming a more active role as opposed to simply filling orders.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“I see my role,” he says, “partly as a catalyst for thought and for questioning. A lot of our work is an open-ended statement which often is not completed until the person who looks at it has reached his or her own conclusion.”</p>
