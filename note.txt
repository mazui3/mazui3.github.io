<p>Addtional question: Can I copy/ trace your art for practice?<br>
  Short answer: No.<br>
  Longer anser: Yes and no.<br>
  If you use any drawing, no matter copy or trace for just fun/ study why it's good, then just do it, enjoy drawing! I do believe all people start drawing from study other one's art, I did that too. So for all most practice reason, yes you can do it, if my art can bring that value, I am happy to know that.<br>
  Then why there's a "no"?<br>
  When you did that practice piece and post it on internet/ or use it in school event/ etc, then there's a consequence.<br>
